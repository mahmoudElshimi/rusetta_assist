# Rusetta Assist Odoo Module

## Introduction

Welcome to the Rusetta Assist Odoo module! ðŸš€

This module is part of my journey of learning Odoo development. It manages basic student attendance, exam records, and marks, including:

- Recording students and their last attendance.
- Managing exams and assigning marks.
- Grouping and filtering based on teachers, exams, dates, and marks.

### Note:
This is not a professional module yet. It's simply a way to share what I am learning. I welcome any contributions, feedback, or suggestions! Remember: RTFM (Read The F*cking Manual) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid!). ðŸ˜Š
